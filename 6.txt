6. Operations

a. Metrics and Alarms

Key Metrics to Monitor:

	•	Event Ingestion Rate: Number of Gerrit events ingested per minute.
	•	Job Trigger Success Rate: Percentage of successfully triggered Jenkins jobs.
	•	Job Completion Time: Time taken for each Jenkins job to complete.
	•	System Latency: Time from event ingestion to sending the vote back to Gerrit.
	•	Error Rates: Number of errors encountered in each stage (event parsing, job triggering, job monitoring, voting).

Alarms:

	•	High Error Rate: Trigger an alarm if the error rate exceeds a threshold.
	•	Job Failure Rate: Trigger an alarm if the percentage of failed Jenkins jobs exceeds a threshold.
	•	High System Latency: Trigger an alarm if the system latency exceeds a threshold.

b. On-Call Engineer Engagement

	•	Engage the on-call engineer when:
	•	The error rate exceeds the threshold.
	•	Jenkins jobs are failing consistently.
	•	The system latency is consistently high, affecting the turnaround time for votes.
	•	There are persistent network issues or connectivity problems with Gerrit or Jenkins.

c. Metrics for Ops Review Meetings

	•	Event Ingestion Rate Trends: Analyze trends over time to ensure the system can handle peak loads.
	•	Job Success/Failure Rates: Review the success and failure rates of triggered Jenkins jobs.
	•	System Latency Distribution: Analyze the distribution of latency to identify any performance bottlenecks.
	•	Error Breakdown: Categorize and analyze errors to identify common failure points.

d. Operator Interaction

	•	Monitoring Dashboards: Use monitoring tools (e.g., Grafana, CloudWatch) to create dashboards for real-time monitoring.
	•	Runbook Entries: Document common operational issues and their resolution steps in a runbook.
	•	Automated Alerts: Set up automated alerts to notify operators of critical issues.

e. CI/CD Automation

	•	Automated Tests: Integrate unit, integration, and end-to-end tests into the CI/CD pipeline.
	•	Performance Tests: Run performance tests as part of the deployment pipeline to ensure the system can handle expected loads.
	•	Deployment Verification: Use canary deployments and automated verification to ensure new changes do not introduce regressions.

f. Logging

	•	Event Logging: Log all received Gerrit events with relevant metadata.
	•	Job Status Logging: Log the status and result of each triggered Jenkins job.
	•	Error Logging: Log detailed error messages and stack traces for any encountered errors.
	•	Latency Logging: Log the time taken for each stage of the process (event ingestion, job triggering, job monitoring, voting).
