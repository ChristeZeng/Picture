Summary

Airflow + Kinesis:

	•	Pros: Extensible, powerful visualization, rule-based triggers, active community, and support.
	•	Cons: Complexity and operational overhead.

Fargate Task with Containers:

	•	Pros: Flexibility, real-time processing, isolation, and security.

Choosing between these two approaches depends on your project’s specific needs, including the importance of real-time processing, ease of use, extensibility, and the ability to scale and maintain the system efficiently.

Overview of Airflow

Apache Airflow is an open-source platform designed to programmatically author, schedule, and monitor workflows. It allows users to define workflows as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) of tasks, which can be easily extended and modified. Airflow provides powerful visualization capabilities, enabling users to see the status of workflows and individual tasks, track progress, and troubleshoot failures. With built-in support for scheduling and task dependencies, Airflow is a robust tool for managing complex workflows in a scalable and resilient manner.

Implementing the Gerrit Trigger with Airflow and Kinesis

In this design, we leverage Airflow in combination with AWS Kinesis to create a highly scalable and resilient Gerrit trigger mechanism. This approach allows us to decouple the trigger logic from individual Jenkins servers, providing a centralized “brain” that coordinates job execution across multiple Jenkins instances. Here’s how the implementation works:

	1.	Event Stream Handling with AWS Kinesis:
	•	AWS Kinesis is used to stream Gerrit events in real-time. Gerrit is configured to send events (e.g., code review submissions) to a Kinesis stream.
	•	A custom sensor in Airflow continuously listens to the Kinesis stream, detecting new events as they occur.
	2.	Event Processing with Airflow:
	•	When a new event is detected in the Kinesis stream, the Airflow DAG is triggered.
	•	The first task in the DAG parses the event to extract relevant information, such as the type of event and associated metadata (e.g., change ID, branch, etc.).
	3.	Job Triggering:
	•	Based on the parsed event data, the DAG determines which Jenkins jobs need to be triggered. This is handled by a PythonOperator in Airflow that interacts with the Jenkins API to start the required jobs.
	•	The DAG can be extended to support different job triggers, allowing flexibility in responding to various types of Gerrit events.
	4.	Job Monitoring:
	•	Once the jobs are triggered, the DAG includes tasks to monitor the status of these jobs. Airflow sensors poll Jenkins to check the progress and completion status of the jobs.
	•	Job statuses are stored in a persistence layer (e.g., Airflow’s XComs or an external database) to ensure that state information is maintained even if the system restarts.
	5.	Returning Votes to Gerrit:
	•	After the jobs complete, the final task in the DAG sends the results back to Gerrit as votes. This task uses the Gerrit REST API to update the code review with the appropriate vote (e.g., +1 or -1) based on the job outcomes.
	6.	Extensibility and Visualization:
	•	Airflow’s DAG-based architecture makes it easy to add or modify tasks, supporting the extension of features such as triggering jobs on other CI/CD platforms or implementing more complex rule patterns for job triggering.
	•	The Airflow web UI provides a clear visualization of the entire workflow, allowing users to monitor the status of each task and the overall process, facilitating easy debugging and management.

This solution offers a scalable and resilient approach to managing Gerrit-triggered workflows, leveraging the strengths of Airflow for workflow management and AWS Kinesis for real-time event streaming.
