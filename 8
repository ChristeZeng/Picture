Our current precommit jobs rely heavily on the Gerrit Trigger plugin, which acts as the sole link between Gerrit and Jenkins. However, this setup has several limitations and challenges, particularly when it comes to coordinating across multiple Jenkins servers and handling service interruptions during deployments. Additionally, the system lacks extensibility to support multiple execution environments, limiting our ability to extend precommit voting to other platforms.
